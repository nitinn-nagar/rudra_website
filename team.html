    <p>RUDRA is the official team of SRM IST taking part in University Rover Challenge organised by Mars Society since 2013. The annual competition is held at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), Martian Analog Site, near Hanksville, Utah, USA. The team
        has been successfully operational for the last 7 years and has maintained its consistency in the competition. Our Team consists of 25-30 undergraduate students of every year from various engineering streams, working in different domains. The fun
